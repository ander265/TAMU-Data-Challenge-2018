# TAMU-Data-Challenge-2018
Dr. Sheather's 2018 Data Challenge at Texas A&amp;M University

Our project assesses over 40GB of raw data collected over 5 years: Millions of records on Chicago Taxi data.
The question our project set to answer was: Is the median taxi driver in Chicago making as much money as before the rise of ridesharing companies such as Lyft.
Note: Ridesharing company data is NOT included in the dataset. The analysis is on traditional cap companies operating within city limits.
